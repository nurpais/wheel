						<p>During 2019, Zain continued to consolidate its position in the Corporate Sustainability space through its pursuit of sustainable growth in the communities in which it operates. From a Group perspective, the company continues to adapt its strategy, agenda, and key performance indicators to ensure that it addresses the most pressing socio-economic challenges. The company recognizes the opportunity to create positive change by leveraging the rapid advancement of technology to derive solutions that can lead to the betterment of society. Zain furthers such initiatives in a bid to address the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and recognizes its role as a private sector player in achieving them.</p>
						<p>The company focused on ensuring concerted action is taken to further cement its prominent role in addressing critical challenges such as climate change, youth unemployment, poverty and economic inclusion. During 2019, the MENA region experienced significant changes across the board. From socio-political unrest, to economic stagnation coupled with a growing working-age population. This overwhelming context presents a gateway for players across different sectors to come together to create a promising future for generations.</p>
						<p>Zain continues to center its strategy on addressing the deficits the communities it serves face, thereby creating value for all. The initiatives derived from the strategy aim to establish sustainable growth. Upon consistent and comprehensive engagement with our stakeholders, Zain identified key areas in which the company continues to play an influential role.</p>
						<p>Further information on the various corporate sustainability areas are below. Also, please note that the annual Zain Group Sustainability Report provides more comprehensive details as found on our website: www.zain.com/sustainability</p>
						<h4>Zain believes that providing Meaningful Connectivity will allow the company to not only scale and advance its products and services but also establish long-term value for all. The organization continues to focus on key sustainability areas that are material to the business, stakeholders and operating communities.</h4>

							<p>Zain recognizes the urgency in addressing the climate crisis. We understand that in order to achieve sustainable growth, the company must protect the planet and preserve its resources. Over the years, Zain has taken major strides to address its environmental footprint by setting concise targets to reduce emissions, minimize waste, spread awareness and identify the risks and opportunities of climate change.</p>
							<p>
							In 2017, Zain set its emission targets for 2022 that are aligned to the International Energy Agency. The company continues to track emission reduction targets on an annual basis. However, the introduction of 5G networks, and rising demand for data and high-speed connectivity leads to network expansion that poses new challenges for the company. In response, Zain continues to mitigate this challenge by installing hybrid and solar solutions, smaller size generators and emphasizes the importance of site sharing. Zain continues to collect data through calculated assumptions based on site topologies. The company uses this method of data collection to standardize the data collection process across its operations due to the lack of the dedicated power metering on some of the sites in specific operations.

							<p>Zain continued to further dedicate time and resources to ensure the sustainability of its supply chain. The company relies heavily on its suppliers to guarantee that it provides high-quality products and services to all its users. As such, Zain prioritizes the integrity of its supply chain by ensuring that it is aligned to the highest social and environmental standards. The company adheres to a specific process when onboarding new suppliers and monitoring its existing ones. Such social and environmental criteria include topics such as: Climate Change, Waste Management, Health and Safety, Energy Consumption, Labor Rights, Human Rights, Child Labor, Discrimination, Security, Stakeholder Engagement, Accountability and Grievance. The company initiated this process in 2017 and a total of 25 suppliers have completed the self-assessment questionnaire that includes the above-mentioned topics.</p>
